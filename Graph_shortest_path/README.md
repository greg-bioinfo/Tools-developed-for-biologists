# Representation of the interactions between two proteins

## Objective
The interaction between 2 proteins is not always direct. It is then interesting to know the intermediary actors.
The human interaction comes from STRING, it contains 16948 proteins and 290849 interactions, saved in text format (edges_string2.txt).

## Settings
 The user must enter the name of the starting protein and the list of target protein names

## Results
The graph represents in red the starting protein in green the target proteins and in blue the proteins through which the shortest path passes.
