# Representation of common biological processes between several proteinsFrom transcriptomic, proteomic or interactomic data, it is interesting to look for common biological pathways.All of the biological processes of each protein were retrieved with the QUICKGO API.The user must enter a list of proteins and obtains a graph in PNG format as well as the list of proteins and their biological processes.The graph represents the listed proteins in red and the biological processes in green. Two proteins are related by a biological process that they share or by the closest common ancestor of their processes. These data come from the Gene Ontology of the goatools library. The thickness of the edges of the graph is proportional to the level of the GO term corresponding to the biological process.hv
