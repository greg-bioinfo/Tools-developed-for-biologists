# Tools-developed-for-biologists

During an internship, in the first year of Master's degree in bioinformatics, within the CRCINA (center for research in immunology and cancerology),
I developed several programs easily usable by biologists in the proteomics field.

I created a Gmail address accessible by all researchers on the platform, with a google drive containing a folder for each tool.

These folders contain google colabs that just need to be run after entering the requested parameters in the corresponding files.
